## Error Handling Philosophy: Fail Loud, Never Fake

Prefer a visible failure over a silent fallback.

- Never silently swallow errors to keep things "working." Surface the error. Don't substitute placeholder data.
- Fallbacks are acceptable only when disclosed. Show a banner, log a warning, annotate the output.
- Design for debuggability, not cosmetic stability.

Priority order:
1. Works correctly with real data
2. Falls back visibly — clearly signals degraded mode
3. Fails with a clear error message
4. Silently degrades to look "fine" — never do this
